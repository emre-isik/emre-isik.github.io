# Welcome!

I am Emre Işık (*pron.* 'Ishik'), currently a scientist at the [Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research](http://www.mps.mpg.de) in Göttingen, Germany. Between 2019-2023 I worked as an associate professor of astroinformatics at the Dept. of Computer Science, [Turkish-German University](http://www.tau.edu.tr/en), in [Beykoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beykoz), [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul), [Türkiye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey). 

Through numerical simulations and data analysis, I explore the physical mechanisms (mostly through MHD simulations) underlying the observed magnetic activity patterns on the Sun and other Sun-like stars, in comparison with observations. When I am not wrangling with models in the theoretical world of wonders, I contribute observational studies of stellar magnetic activity. Thanks to my recent years of teaching and supervising in (astro)informatics, I enriched my toolbox with machine-learning methods. In a recent excursion to astrobiology, I worked on modelling thermodynamics of organic reaction networks in ocean-world interiors. Click on the links below to see my research summaries.

I am serving as the elected vice president of the [Inter-Division Commission E4 "Impact of Magnetic Activity on Solar and Stellar Environments"](https://iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/commissions/E4/info/) of the [International Astronomical Union (IAU)](https://www.iau.org). 

🚨 **NEWS** -- In June 2025, I co-organised an ISSI Workshop at the International Space Science Institute (Bern, Switzerland), entitled [**Stellar Magnetism and its Impact on (Exo)planets**](https://workshops.issibern.ch/stellar-magnetism/). Nowadays I am leading a book chapter on stellar magnetic activity. 

🚨 **NEWS** (12.01.2026) -- The Turkish-Japanese joint research project **Exploring The Connection Between Chromospheric Activity and Starspots in Late-Type Active Stars: Implications for Dynamo Evolution** (2026-2028) has been awarded funding from TUBITAK and JSPS! I am a consultant and collaborator in the project, co-led by H.V. Şenavcı (Ankara University) and D. Nogami (Kyoto University).
