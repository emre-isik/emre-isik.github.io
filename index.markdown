# Welcome!

I am Emre Işık (*pron.* 'Ishik'), currently a scientist at the [Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research](http://www.mps.mpg.de) in Göttingen, Germany. Between 2019-2023 I worked as an associate professor of astroinformatics at the Dept. of Computer Science, [Turkish-German University](http://www.tau.edu.tr/en), in [Beykoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beykoz), [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul), [Türkiye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey). 

Through numerical simulations and data analysis, I am exploring the physical mechanisms (mostly through MHD simulations) underlying the observed magnetic activity patterns on the Sun and other Sun-like stars, in comparison with observations. Thanks to my recent years of teaching and supervising in (astro)informatics, I am somewhat machine-learning-ready. I am also interested in astrobiology, and recently started working on modelling organic reaction favourability in ocean-world interiors. Click on the links below to see my research summaries. 

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emre_ishik) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emre-Isik), or write to me directly: isik (mps.mpg.de).
